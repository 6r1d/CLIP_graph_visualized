# A visualized CLIP graph

A tiny page made to visualize a graph made of many many tags for a [CLIP neural network](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) that converts text to images.
Uses an amazing [Force-directed graph renderer](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) by [Vasco Asturiano](https://github.com/vasturiano) to display the graph.
